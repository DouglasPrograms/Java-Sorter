## What Is JSort? 

JSort is a visual sorting algorithm that gives you the option to use a variety of sorting algorithms to sort a data set of either random generated numbers or a custom data set of numbers (be sure to put commas number after number), and you can edit the speed of how fast the algorithm performs the sorting algorithm. A console is provided as you can see the output of your edits or results.
